# Drowsiness Detection System
The Drowsiness Detection System represents a pivotal advancement in driver safety technology, addressing the pervasive issue of driver fatigue-related accidents. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system accurately assesses the driver's alertness level in real-time, enabling timely intervention to prevent potential accidents. The incorporation of multiple detection methods and priority-based alerting ensures robust performance across varying degrees of drowsiness. Overall, the system's cost-effectiveness, coupled with its ability to function with minimal hardware requirements, makes it a practical solution for enhancing road safety.

The project focuses on employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based Autoencoders
for the task of anomaly detection in Electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The primary objective is to
train an autoencoder to learn the intrinsic representation of normal ECG patterns and utilize
various loss functions, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Huber loss, Mean Absolute Error
(MAS), and Cosine Similarity, to assess the model's performance. The dataset used is The
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, providing a diverse collection of ECG recordings.

User Authentication System: Features a login with multi-factor authentication (MFA), a CAPTCHA, and a password reset mechanism via mail with proper rate limiting.

### Database Initialization
The database script creates three tables: users, admins, and comments, and populates them with sample data. Users and admins are added with hashed passwords for security.

    python database_init.py

### Usage
Start the application:

    python app.py
Access it via http://localhost:5000 in a web browser to interact with the honeypot's features.

### Outcomes and Findings
The project generates visualizations, including sample plots for each loss function, to facilitate a
comparative understanding of the model's performance. These plots, showcasing actual ECG
data compared to the reconstructed data by the CNN autoencoder, are saved as HTML files for
easy integration into the project. The visualizations enable a comprehensive assessment of how
each loss function influences the model's ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal
heart rhythms.
### Conclusion
The use of CNN-based Autoencoders, coupled with a thorough exploration of various loss
functions, demonstrates a promising approach to anomaly detection in ECG data. The project
highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate loss function based on the nature of the
data and the desired model behavior. The insights gained contribute to the advancement of
deep learning techniques for medical anomaly detection, particularly in cardiovascular health.
